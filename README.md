## Features

- **üîê User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionality.
- **üìñ Story Creation:** Easy-to-use editor for writing and formatting stories.
- **üì± Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **üîó Story Sharing:** Share stories with others through unique URLs.

## Key Takeaways

Working on the Hikari project has been an enriching experience that provided valuable insights and skills in various areas:

- **Frontend Development**: Gained experience in React and TypeScript.
- **Backend Development**: laerned about prisma acclerate and pooling.
- **State Management**: Implemented efficient state management using React Query and Hooks.
- **Responsive Design**: Improved skills in Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend Development**: Used serverless architecture with Cloudflare Workers.
- **HonoJS, Prisma, NeonDB**: Explored differences from traditional Node.js setups.

### Problems and Solutions:
- **Image Storage**: Learned about Cloudflare Images and R2 for storing images, though faced issues due to lack of credit card for full implementation.
- **Editor Choice**: Preferred NoteBlock over Tiptap and Editor.js for its fast bootstrap. Future projects may use Tiptap for its extensive features.
- **Auth Context**: Initially used AuthContext but switched to a simple useUser hook with React Query for better caching.

This project has not only expanded my technical skills but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities and collaboration techniques.

## Getting Started
